        Air has been designing an application to plunge into Angular to write code quickly. Then, 
        some people slow you down. They want you to take your time and make a good decision 
        in your career. We must slow things down to March and avoid making an early flop. 
        This is another write-up about creating beautiful-looking web pages in the first go 
        in ten minutes. There are plenty of instructions in the documentation that tell you we 
        can do this in like five hours, 10 hours, six months; we can be this excellent developer 
        who has a career, and there's a paycheck that comes to you every month. one we have designed 
        the website, there's no way we can change the design, layout, the javascript frameworks or 
        the libraries we have chosen—the choice of font, style sheet, and colors we decided to design 
        the website. Everyone is waiting to make the next gig. I can write as much as Air wants, 
        slowly and steadily, wanting to write this for another twenty minutes. 
        Is it even possible to keep writing something at a steady pace? I took one tablet of Tylenol yesterday and have 
        lost its cover to understand how much dosage of this painkiller I need to take to remain pain-free. One Tylenol is 650 mg. 
        Air used the binoculars again to read the fine print. There were no directions on the box to see how many of these to swallow. 
        To be safe, Air took one Tylenol, and the pain was seeing if it needed to creep in more. The body has gone in shock. 
        play the song.

        Tia introduced This song to me out of nowhere after we stepped out of the federal building, standing in the queue for about three hours preparing all the documents needed to get my passport in hand. There's a specific dynamic when we step in line and wait for security. About ten people can stand in the queue, and another ten can stand past the roundabout door. We don't want to stand too close to people so that we don't breathe into other people, or we need to repress our thoughts so that we don't say something out of context without rhyme or reason. It means we need to be in touch with the reality, not understanding what and why the other person is here, just like anyone else. A lady was walking with her two children with a cart to hold the baby's toys and other essentials that were needed and well planned out for their extended stay in the line. The commentator or the office critic was annoyed that he stepped in too early into the roundabout, and the security officer stopped them from entering the building. Just doing their job, asserting her control, so folks listened and followed the instructions. Forget to shut the ears. There's no auto shut-off where we can't filter something coming out of someone's mouth, which we know doesn't stand a chance of being appreciated by anyone.
        Yet we do this without any consideration. The words uttered were something along the lines of, Did they empty everything they had in their home and move in here so that the security could scan them? Finally, it was our turn. The lady carries the handbag so Tia can empty the wallet, belt, coat, cell phone, and files into the gift bag. I waited until someone called me to step along with them. The voice behind me muttered, March together? Why is the human still standing here? The annoyance needed more space. Step out of the grey line to join Tia. Pictures of President Biden, VP Kamala Harris smiling, and Washington D.C. landmarks decorated the wall. The license plate number for their car is LPW 5992, after paying ten dollars for the parking lot and crossing the street. What has happened so far? We went to the fourth floor to stand in line to submit the documents, and Air was given a ticket, A169. The guard had already stopped them and didn't allow any family members inside and told in the fastest way possible, to go to the cafeteria and have some coffee there, and one of us could stand in line. Air was in line since it was her passport. Air couldn't hear what the person in the window was asking and had to tell her to repeat what she was saying. It is better not to ask any questions. No one understands what we are saying, and they completely understand what Air is there for. It is hilarious that a person can be in both the state at the same time.
