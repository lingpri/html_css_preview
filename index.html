        Air has been designing an application to plunge into Angular to write code quickly. Take time and not make a flop early in a career. Slow things down to march with confidence. 
        This is another write-up about creating beautiful-looking web pages in the first go in ten minutes. There are plenty of instructions do this in like five hours, 10 hours, six months; 
        An excellent developer who has a career, and there's a paycheck that comes every month. once the website is designed, there's no way we can change the design, layout, the javascript frameworks or 
        the libraries we have chosen—the choice of font, style sheet, and colors we decided to design the website. Everyone is waiting to make the next gig. Air wants to write, slowly and steadily, 
        wanting to write this for another twenty minutes. Is it even possible to keep writing something at a steady pace? After taking one tablet of Tylenol yesterday and have lost its cover to understand how much dosage of this painkiller 
        remain pain-free. One Tylenol is 650 mg. Binoculars again to read the fine print. There were no directions on the box to see how much she could eat. To be safe, Air ate one Tylenol, and the pain was seeing if it 
        needed to creep in more. The body has gone in shock. Air sang the song.

        புல்வெளி புல்வெளி தன்னில் பனித்துளி <br>
        பனித்துளி பாரம்மா <br>
        அதை சூரியன் சூரியன் வந்து செல்லமாய் செல்லமாய்  கிள்ளி எழுப்புது எழுப்புது ஏனம்மா <br>
        இதயம் பறவை போல் ஆகுமா <br>
        பறந்தால் வானமே போதுமா <br>

        Tia introduced This song came out of nowhere after we stepped out of the federal building, standing in the queue for about three hours preparing all the documents needed to get passport in hand. 
        There's a specific dynamic when we step in line and wait for security. About ten people can stand in the queue, and another ten can stand past the roundabout door. We don't want to stand too close to people 
        so that we don't breathe into other people, or we need to repress our thoughts so that we don't say something out of context without rhyme or reason. It means we need to be in touch with the reality, 
        not understanding what and why the other person is here, just like anyone else. A lady was walking with her two children with a cart to hold the baby's toys and other essentials that were needed and well planned 
        ut for their extended stay in the line. The commentator or the office critic was annoyed that he stepped in too early into the roundabout, and the security officer stopped us from entering the building. 
        She was doing her job, asserting her control, so folks listened and followed the instructions. There's no auto shut-off where I can't filter something coming out of someone's mouth, 
        which we know doesn't stand a chance of being appreciated by anyone. yet we do this without any consideration. The words uttered were something along the lines of, Did they empty everything they had in their home 
        and move in here so that the security could scan them? Finally, it was our turn. The ladies carry the handbag with their Tia to empty their wallets, belts, coats, cell phones, and files into the bag. Air waited until 
        someone called to step along with them. The voice behind air muttered, Together? still standing here? The annoyance needed more space. Air stepped out of the grey line to join Tia. 
        Noticed the pictures of Roar and Smiley when they were about to enter the elevator. Oh yeah, Air forgot the license plate number again for her car. It goes something like 5992. 
        Paid ten dollars for the parking lot and crossed the street. So yeah, go back and re-read to gain. What has happened so far? We went to the fourth floor to stand in line to submit the documents, 
        and we were given a ticket, A169. The guard had already stopped them and didn't allow any family members inside and told in the fastest way possible, to go to the cafeteria and have some coffee there, 
        and one of them could stand in line. Air was in line since it was her passport. Air couldn't hear what the person in the window was asking and had to tell her to repeat what she was saying. 
        It is better not to ask any questions. No one understands what we are saying, and they completely understand what Air is there for. It is hilarious that a person can be in both the state at the same time.

      Do we get annoyed or jealous when we see someone is supposedly better than us? People who have built frameworks for language creators like C++, Java, and JavaScript, languages like English, Tamil, and Telugu. 
      There are rules for learning the language, and who are the pioneers who can teach the tricks of the trade? People would want to work with us if someone sees some value in what we have done. 
      Do we study in hackerrank and spend 15,000 $ in boot camp to land a dream job? It all entirely depends. Thanks to the Tylenol. I found the cover this morning and the directions that go with it. 
      I took two tablets every 8 hours, and as time passed, I could breathe to around 11.30 a.m. to eat one dosai with egg and make one more dosai for Bambi. I was watching the videos in Scrimba to see how we can 
      learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and angular. It looks good on the surface and is a well designed web page. They have study groups and meet up in Discord to hang out as a community so that someone can review the code. 
      I watched a few videos in angular, explaining what's the big picture. So, the components and the services are some of the building blocks of an angular project. A htttp module can be imported into the service layer, which returns a result of an HTTP response that can be returned as a collection of objects in the type script. So, a value will be returned continuously with optional handlers like complete and error. It's a stream of values, and there's no single value. As we keep typing, more values will be returned over a period invoked using next(). Imagine a car is moving. If we want someone else to listen to where we are at, we can do so in this method, which emits a value of x and y in the following position. When the vehicle has stopped, we can do some clean-ups in the complete procedure. The component listening to these x and y values can update the grid in real time the x and y values using data binding, where the value flows from source to view. This is done using square brackets, otherwise known as property binding. There are two kinds of decorators: input and output decorators, which can be wired to pass information from a parent to a child component using the @Input decorator. If the child component needs to propagate the changes to the parent, it can use the @output decorator and event emitter. A similar concept exists in the Adobe Flex application as well. We can import an event emitter to emit the entire object, partials or omit things in the typescript. Unable to choose Whether I can afford to pay for anything extra other than my time is what the current state of affairs is. It is a long and complicated journey ahead. We need to sit on this for a while. We are taking one day at a time. 
      It's critical to block out bad news, as we all don't know when will the death sentence be announced.
